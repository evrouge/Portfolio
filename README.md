# Portfolio

Hi!

I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery for this portfolio!

When clicking on the "click to open bio" button, you will see a popup containing information about myself, and once you are done reading, you can close the button in the top left corner.

When clicking on the Resume and Portfolio button, the script will show, and upon clicking again, they will close.

Last, you will see that when you hover your mouse over the bottom buttons, they will change color, and when you click the button it will take you to my LinkedIn page and my Github.
