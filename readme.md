Hi!

I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery for this portfolio!

When clicking on the "click to open bio" button, you will see a popup containing information about my favorite activities, and once you are done reading, you can close the button on the left side of the popup.

When clicking on the Resume and Portfolio button, the script will show, and upon clicking again, they will close. In my portfolio, you will see pictures that I have painted, as I do not have any other projects to display here yet.

Bringing your mouse over to the bottom of the page, you will see that not only do the LinkedIn and Github buttons change color when your mouse is on them, they will take you to those specific links!

At the bottom of the page you will see a "home" button that will reset everything and take you back to the top of the page.
